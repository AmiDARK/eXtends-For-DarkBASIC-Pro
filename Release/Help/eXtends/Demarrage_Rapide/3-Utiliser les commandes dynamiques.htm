  <b>Lesson 1<BR>
  HOW TO use the dynamic media system.<BR>
  </b> 
</CENTER>
<p><FONT SIZE=2><br>
  </FONT>DarkBASIC Professional use a static way of creating medias. This mean 
  you need to choose a number before creating the object.<br>
  For example, if we want to load our Hero using default DarkBASIC Professional 
  commands, we'll do this :<BR>
  <br>
  <font color="#6699FF"><b><font color="#0000FF">Load Object</font></b></font> 
  &quot;hero.x&quot;, 1</p>
<p>The number 1 define that the object index will be 1. Problems appear when we 
  have a large amount of objects... More the project will be near to its completion, 
  more objects we'll have. This also mean that we'll have to memorize which numbers 
  are used by which objects. It become then hard to remind exactly all objects 
  and number associates without a written list.<br>
  <br>
  The main advantage of this plugin is to allow user to not take care of the medias 
  numbers. The command will set it for him. It's the &quot;Dynamic&quot; way for 
  media handling. User will have to use a named variable, a table or a variable 
  in a type to store the number returned by the function. It's then easy to name 
  a global variable : Hero and use it. We'll proceed like follow using the plugin 
  command :<br>
  <br>
  Hero = <font color="#0000FF"><b>B3D Load Object</b></font>(&quot;Hero.x&quot;)<br>
  <br>
  It is easier to use named variables especially when the choosen name is linked 
  to the media use. When you'll have to modify the media, position it, scale it, 
  and make other changes, it will be easy to simply use the default DarkBASIC 
  Professional commands replacing the object number by the variable. It will be 
  like this :<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0000FF"><b>Position Object</b></font> Hero, X, Y, Z</p>
<p>You no more need to use number. Variable is here now and when you check the 
  line, you know that the object that will be positionned is the &quot;hero&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  That exemple is dedicaced to 3D Objects but the plugin contain the same commands 
  for other medias like sounds, musics, memblocks, images and files...<br>
  <br>
  WARNING !!! : To be sure that the &quot;Dynamic&quot; system will work perfectly, 
  you must not use default DarkBASIC Professional creation/clone/instance/load 
  commands when commands from the plugin are used.<br>
