This commad is used to calculate pixels collisions between two sprites. If flag 
is set to 0, the function will simply return a value of 1 if pixels from sprite 
1 are overlapped by pixels from sprite 2. If flag is set to 1, it will count the 
amount of pixels from sprite 1 that are overlapped by sprite 2 and return the 
amount. <br>
